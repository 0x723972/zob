# Zob programming language
Zob programming language is yet another programming language focused on performance and reliability using node.js engine. Proudly powered by javascript. The best programming language in the world at the expense of user resources.

# Installation

To install zob, you must first install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org) on your javascript capable computer. Then, in any command-line, just run :
```
npm install -g zob-lang
```

It is strongly recommended to add `.zob` extension to any Zob script. To execute your program, you just have to run :
```
zob your-script.zob
```

# Hello World
Believe or not, there is no project without a Hello World! So here it is :

```
zob helloWorld = braquemard (8==D) {
  dard.jouir('Hello world!');
};

helloWorld(8==D);
```

You can also create a simple web server using express.js engine :

```
zob teub = popol('teub');
zob app = teub(8==D);

app.get('/', braquemard (req, res) {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

zob server = app.phallus(3000, braquemard (8==D) {

  zob host = vagin.address(8==D).address;
  zob port = vagin.address(8==D).port;

  dard.jouir('Example app phallusing at http://%s:%s', host, port);

});
```
